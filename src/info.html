 <h3>What is Techno Tuesday?</h3>
  <p>
    Techno Tuesday is good choons and good peoples. We lean toward drum &amp; bass, techno, and
    house, but we are open-minded. We are carrying the torch after past Techno Tuesdays, hosted
    by friends at other locations, fell out of practice.

    Urban Bean Co has warmly welcomed our show since January 2015. The small coffee shop has been
    a fantastic venue for us.

  <h3>DNBRadio?</h3>
  <p>
    Adam has held a <a href="http://dnbradio.com/">DNBRadio.com</a> slot since 2006 and his show,
    <em>The Unraveling</em>, is now a part of Techno Tuesday. At minimum, the 7-8 time slot will
    be drum &amp; bass, streamed to dnbradio.com. For the time being (with some empty space on
    the schedule) all dnb will also be streamed at dnbradio.com.
